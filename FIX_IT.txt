TO FIX THE COMPILER ERROR IN CURSOR:

1. Open in Cursor's terminal:
   open /Users/hasti/Desktop/InvestmentApp/InvestmentApp/InvestmentApp.xcodeproj

2. Or, copy the working minimal version from Xcode

3. The issue is the complex gesture expressions - they're too nested.

4. Simplest solution: Remove the advanced zoom gestures temporarily

5. The chart will still work with basic panning!

TO BUILD FROM CURSOR:
cd /Users/hasti/Desktop/InvestmentApp/InvestmentApp
xcodebuild build -project InvestmentApp.xcodeproj -scheme InvestmentApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' && open -a Simulator
